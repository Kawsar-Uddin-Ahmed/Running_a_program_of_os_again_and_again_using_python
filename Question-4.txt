1. You wanted to run a bat file on a specific date and time. ( say wanted to run calculator) 
2. create a python program that will run on a specific date and time ( but don't use the default scheduler)

Hint : 
datetime function. use
target datetime - datetime =0 then execute

There are many ways .... google it please

N.B: without putting the file in the default scheduler you cannot succeed
